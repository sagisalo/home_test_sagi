hello,

this is the manual for using my argos.py code.

the first command will be building the docker image.
$ docker build -t <image_name> .
notice the space after the name, it is crucial for the command syntax

the second command is running the code.
$ python argos.py

thats it, now you can view the results:
data_db -database with all the needed data, divided to two tables - data and tags which have primary key TITLE.
Links_time - text file. time from "clicking" the link until new page loaded
Search_query_time - text file. time for executing the search query. from typing correct url and pressing ENTER.

####the code is written with notes
